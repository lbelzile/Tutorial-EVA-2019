# EVA 2019 Tutorial

This folder contains the slides and datasets from the EVA 2019 R package tutorial.

Since some packages are voluminous, we encourage to install the packages ahead of time using the command

```
install.packages(c("extRemes","RandomFields","SpatialExtremes","mvPot","mev","revdbayes","cobs", "sp", "ggplot2"))
install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
```
The code for the `mev` tutorial will be available at https://lbelzile.github.io/mevtuto/.

For the `mvPot` tutorial, please read the file `workshop_instructions.pdf`located in the corresponding folder.
